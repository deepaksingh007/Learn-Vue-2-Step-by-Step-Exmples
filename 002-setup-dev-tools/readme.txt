Download the Vue Devtools extension for a better development experience:
https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools


Important Usage Notes
If the page uses a production/minified build of Vue.js, devtools inspection is disabled by default so the Vue pane won't show up.

To make it work for pages opened via file:// protocol, you need to check "Allow access to file URLs" for this extension in Chrome's extension management panel.
